define('INDEX_CONTENT', '<span>Nowadays there are hundreds of millions, if not billiards, pieces of paper in uninterrupted circulation. Every second reports, leaflets, papers, books, notes, letters or other documents are given from hand to hand. But it is also true that every day, every hour and every minute one of these pieces of paper is replaced by its &#34;e&#8211;&#34; (which means electronic) equivalent. Thanks to possibilities which are given to us by the computers, phones and Internet most of us choose electronic solutions. We live in times when people intuitively choose technology. Letters are being displaced by SMS or emails, e&#8211;books are constantly replacing stacks of books. Traditional banking turned into e&#8211;banking. It\'s all due to developing technology, which is more and more perfect and innovative. Progress and expansion are unavoidable now - it is an important element in the development of every civilization. As our ancestors invented scripture &#8211; in time picture writing turned into today\'s letter &#8211; in which this text has been written. Not only the way of writing has changed but the surface of writing has also changed &#8211; long ago there were stone walls, then stone tablets and finally there was the invention of parchment. At present electronics leads the way.</span></p>
        <p><span>This is the topic of our site &#8211; we wanna show you benefits and drawbacks of using new technology. We will compare the &#34;old&#34; one (paper) with the &#34;new&#34; one ("e&#8211;"devices). We will show it in many ways. We guarantee that the time spent here won\'t be wasted, and everyone will find something for themselves.</span></p>
